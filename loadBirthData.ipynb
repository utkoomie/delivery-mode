    "### Load Relevant Birth Data from Raw CDC files\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook parses raw CDC (denominator) text files year by year and imports a subset of available variables into pandas dataframe. The resulting dataframe is saved to pickle files for use with subsequent analysis utilities (files are stored in a `data/` subdirectory). Births to non U.S. residents are **not** included.  Variables extracted from the raw CDC files are controlled via a companion runtime config file defined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "CDC files are availalbe for download at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm#Births.  Note that this analysis uses the **period-linked** files from the CDC.\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Runtime Input Controls\n",
    "To use this utility you will first need to have copies of the public CDC data downloaded locally for each year you want to parse (note that the CDC provides *zip* files which need to be decompressed after download).  The parsing utility assumes that the filenames remain unchanged and are organized in subdirectories indicating each calendar year.  Once downloaded, update the `dataDir` option in the companion runtime configFile (config.period) to define the  top-level file path location of the local files.  Finally, update the *years* variable below to define a list of years to parse. The companion *config.period* input file is configured to accomodate years ranging from 2005-2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: on a typical system, it can take upwards of 10 minutes to load and parse data for a given year. "
